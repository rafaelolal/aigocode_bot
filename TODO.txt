Add problem id on the spreadsheet

Make the singleplaye channel id for each guild
    be the id of the channel and the id of the message with the view
When removing making a channel not singleplayer anymore
    delete the message with the stored id in the stored channel id
Make it so that as people text in that channel, the message deletes itself
    and is sent again every 5 minutes or so
    every 5 minutes check if the last message has the id stored
    if not, resend it
