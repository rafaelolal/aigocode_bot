For fun, they have invented a simple number game to play during the meeting to keep themselves entertained.\nElsie has three positive integers A, B, and C (A≤B≤C). These integers are supposed to be secret, so she will not directly reveal them to her sister Bessie. Instead, she gives Bessie seven (not necessarily distinct) integers in the range 1…10^9, claiming that they are A, B, C, A+B, B+C, C+A, and A+B+C in some order.\n\nGiven a list of these seven numbers, please help Bessie determine A, B, and C. It can be shown that the answer is unique.$$The first line of the input contains T, the number of test case. The following T lines consists of seven space-separated integers.$$Print A, B, and C separated by spaces.$$1\n2 2 11 4 9 7 9$$2 2 7$$$$25$$https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zsxPkFzmZHbcOIUe1LUutXGisEmfcuj5$$https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xSIEmh5BMhdN10SppZOdvYHjfrHXbvXH$$rafaelpbcp@gmail.com$$Bronze$$$$$$$$FALSE$$FALSE$$https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxcPEqPIXIahiRUdRONH01IFKqQeoIGmzwpSeKQV-WTszM4Q/viewform?edit2=2_ABaOnucXc9I2XJVl5Ed1g_z0JZAlMdqLGGzbFr2XQY-tYR7scQCE11anUZsYz51glVPW6tE

For example, the string CABABC has a goodness score of 2 since S2≠S5 and S3≠S4.\n\nCharles gave Ada a string S of length N, consisting of uppercase letters and asked her to convert it into a string with a goodness score of K. In one operation, Ada can change any character in the string to any uppercase letter. Could you help Ada find the minimum number of operations required to transform the given string into a string with goodness score equal to K?$$The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers N and K. The second line of each test case contains a string S of length N, consisting of uppercase letters.$$The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T.

Therefore the minimum number of operations required is 0.\n\nIn Sample Case #2, one option is to change the character at index 1 to B in order to have a goodness score of 2. Therefore, the minimum number of operations required is 1.$$25$$https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KmCON7-ZPR0MlFfqvfRmsc8PVfgUQQLF$$https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xI8mlKC33Ncg6Praga_Te1vfyLUwhWDG$$rafaelpbcp@gmail.com$$$$$$A$$$$FALSE$$FALSE$$https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxcPEqPIXIahiRUdRONH01IFKqQeoIGmzwpSeKQV-WTszM4Q/viewform?edit2=2_ABaOnuce6Z3gc1gv-6jFJ0lsAgvdsOHyCWFkarNbm_lj8AvWtzWnxts4OaBAqr4V5AY-q-Y
